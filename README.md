# Reaction-Time-Bot
A bot that automatically clicks the green pixels on the https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime website.  

### This only works on windows because I used the windows API!
### I also just realised that I use a chrome extension called DarkReader which means that my rgb values for the green pixel will not work for any web browser without the exension. To fix this: throw an image of the reaction time test turning green into an image editor such as paint and select the pixels' rgb values (Obviously of the green part). Put these values into the code on line 16;
  - *if (colour == RGB(R value here, G value here, B value here))*.  

https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime is the website used  
https://gyazo.com/008b17042b583a18fe08989f901cd49d are results  

## You can also make a faster reaction time bot through another method which I may make in some other form on another repo.
